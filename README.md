## 🎭 What is This?

Pathfinder 2.0 is a **TikTok-style learning experience** that turns boring roadmaps into an **immersive, gamified flow**. No more static lists. No more endless scrolling through roadmap.sh clones.

Just **pure, focused learning**.

### ✨ The Experience

```
1. THE HOOK    →  Type your obsession
2. THE FLOW    →  Swipe through fullscreen steps
3. THE MASTER  →  Hold to charge, blast to the next level
```
